# 🧠 From Bootloaders to Robots — My Early System-Level Exploration

> This repository documents my early hands-on adventures in embedded systems, firmware customization, and hardware tinkering — long before I entered the professional world.

## 🔓 Android Bootloader Hacking (Junior High ~ High School)

- **HTC Desire / Sensation**:
  - Used `adb` and `fastboot` to unlock bootloaders (via HTC Dev).
  - Flashed third-party recoveries like **4EXT**.
  - Installed custom ROMs like **ViperOS** (from XDA).
  - Overclocked CPU and modified kernel parameters for performance.
  - Debug sessions sometimes took hours

## 🤖 Robotics Competition - Obstacle Avoidance Robot (High School)

- Programmed Arduino-based robot using **C++**.
- Used **IR sensors** to detect obstacles and make directional decisions.
- Firmware uploaded via **COM Port (USB)** using Dev-C++.
- Spent time tuning thresholds and behavior in actual field tests.

## 🌐 Network Virtualization & System Setup (College)

- Set up **pfSense** firewall and **OpenMediaVault** NAS using **VMware / VirtualBox**.
- Configured IP and **port forwarding** to expose VM web UIs via host network (e.g., `192.168.1.1:80` → `10.80.70.100:7788`).
- Learned practical networking: NAT, firewall rules, and interface bridging.

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used

- **Languages**: C++, PHP (for school backend project)
- **Tools**: Arduino, Dev-C++, adb/fastboot, HTC Dev, VMware, VirtualBox
- **Skills**: Bootloader unlocking, flashing recovery, debugging ROM, sensor logic, basic Linux networking, soldering, digital logic, electrical circuit testing (with multimeter)

## 💬 Why This Matters

These experiences weren’t part of a class or job — I pursued them out of pure interest. I was the kid who wanted to know *how the system actually boots*, not just how to use an app. That early obsession is what led me down the path of system software and embedded engineering.

## 📌 Note

This repo is a retrospective log. The original files, firmware, and source code are long gone — but the lessons and mindset still shape how I approach engineering today.
